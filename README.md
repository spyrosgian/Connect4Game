# Connect4Game
This is a Git repository that contains the Java program for _Assignment 2 of Principles of Programming_ 
module of the MSc Computer Science of University of Bath.

The game Connect4 is a game that can be played between a human and a computer player, on a 6x7 grid. The goal is to connect 4 tokens either diagonally, horizontally or vertically.

There are two versions for this game:

Version 1: A Java program that allows a human to play the game Connect4 against 1 computer using a 6x7 grid.

Version 2: A Java program that allows a human to play the game ConnectN against 1 computer using a 6x7 grid.

ConnectN is a game identical to Connect4 except that:

The winning condition is that N counters of the same colour are placed in a line and
one human player competes against two computer players.

N is passed to the code as a command line argument and 2 < N < 7.
